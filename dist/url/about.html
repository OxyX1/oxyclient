        <h3>What is oxyclient?</h3>
        <p>Oxyclient is designed to bypass software restrictions from services like GoGuardian, Securly, Fortinet, and more.</p>
        <p>Oxyclient was launched on February 18, 2025. Major updates are planned to ensure it remains the best proxy software available.</p>

        <br><br>

        <h1>Why was oxyclient made?</h1>
        <p>Oxyclient was created because I, Oxy, was tired of unreliable proxies like Interstellar or Shuttle. With those, you can’t even access apps like Snapchat or Discord without needing someone else to verify the account.</p>
        <p>Additionally, Oxyclient was developed to provide a faster, more reliable network—and, of course, to generate revenue.</p>
        <p>It supports captcha functionality and includes its own undetected proxy by acting as a google browser. for seamless browsing.</p>
